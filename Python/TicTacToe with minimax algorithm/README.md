## TicTacToe with minimax algorithm <br>

This program implements Minimax algorithm in the game of TicTacToe. The UI is designed using 'Tkinter' module in python.
It has no heuristic (depth parameter and horizon effect) so it plays at infinite strength. 
With this game that is possible, because of it limited set of possible states.

The program can be made efficient using alpha beta pruning, which will be dealt with in a seperate project.
